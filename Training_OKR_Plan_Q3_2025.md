**Project** **Proposal:** **The** **Training** **Intelligence**
**Engine**

This document outlines a 6-month strategic initiative to transform the
new hire training process from a series of time-consuming manual tasks
into an efficient, data-driven, and

semi-automated system. Our goal is to eliminate administrative
bottlenecks, improve the reliability of performance data, and free up
the Training Lead to focus on high-impact coaching and development.

**TLDR** **Version**

**First** **90** **Days** **(July** **-** **Oct** **2025):** **Build**
**the** **Automated** **Data** **Engine**

We will first eliminate the most time-consuming manual data work.

> ● **Weeks** **1-4:** We'll automate sending welcome emails and
> creating individual trainee scorecards.
>
> ● **Weeks** **5-8:** We'll automate checking those scorecards for
> completeness and then pull all the data into a master performance
> dashboard, eliminating hours of manual
>
> copy-pasting.
>
> ● **Weeks** **9-12:** We'll automate basic scheduling,
> inter-departmental requests, and the post-training feedback loop.

**Outcome** **in** **90** **Days:** A system that automatically manages
scorecard creation, data quality, and score aggregation, saving over 5
hours of manual work per batch.

**Next** **90** **Days** **(Oct** **2025** **-** **Jan** **2026):**
**Deliver** **Advanced** **Intelligence**

With the data engine running, we will use it to solve our most complex
problems.

> ● **Month** **4:** We will build the "Advanced Scheduler" to
> automatically handle the complex, role-specific sessions for Days 4-6.
>
> ● **Month** **5:** We will create an "Early Warning System" that
> analyzes performance data to flag struggling trainees for proactive
> coaching.
>
> ● **Month** **6:** We will plan the migration of our proven
> automations into a more deeply integrated platform to maximize
> efficiency.

**Outcome** **in** **6** **Months:** A semi-automated training
operations system that handles scheduling, aggregates performance, and
provides predictive insights to improve trainee success.

**Breakdown**

**The** **90-Day** **"Small** **Wins** **to** **Big** **Wins"**
**Roadmap**

**Guiding** **Principle:** Each step must solve a documented pain point
while creating a foundational component for the next, bigger step.

**Win** **1:** **The** **Automated** **Welcome** **&** **Resource**
**Pack**

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (July 28 - August 8)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

Trainers spend up to 30 minutes per batch on repetitive guidance and
follow-up for new hires who frequently ask for information that has
already been provided.

**Our** **Solution:**

An automation that triggers when a new hire is added to our master
Google Sheet. It will instantly send a welcome email containing all
essential resources: links to the Lark Wiki, a schedule overview, and
answers to FAQs

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This is the lowest-effort, highest-return starting point. It provides
immediate time savings while forcing us to create the master "New Hire
List," which is the foundational trigger for all subsequent automations.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Reduce repetitive, ad-hoc questions from new hires by 50%.

**Win** **2:** **The** **Automated** **Scorecard** **Duplicator**

**Timeline:** Week 3-4 (August 11 - August 22)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

Manually creating and sharing individual scorecard files for every new
hire, a process that is the first step in a 3.5 to 4+ hour manual
assessment workflow.

**Our** **Solution:**

A workflow that automatically copies the correct role-specific scorecard
template from Google Drive, renames it using a standard convention, and
shares it with the appropriate coach.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This creates a consistent, reliable "digital twin" for each trainee's
performance journey. It is the essential second step in our data
pipeline; we cannot aggregate data until its containers are created
systematically.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Reduce scorecard creation and sharing time from over 2 minutes per hire
to less than 10 seconds.

**Win** **3:** **The** **Incomplete** **Scorecard** **Alerter**

**Timeline:** Week 5-6 (August 25 - September 5)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The high risk of data integrity errors caused by incomplete scorecards,
which requires the trainer to manually audit records and chase coaches
for missing data.

**Our** **Solution:**

An automation that scans all scorecards for a batch at the end of
training. If a critical score field is empty, it automatically sends a
polite reminder email to the coach.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This automation acts as an automated "quality gate" for our data
pipeline. It ensures data is reliable at the source, which is a
prerequisite for trustworthy reporting and a massive reduction in manual
rework.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Reduce the number of scorecards with missing data by 90%, eliminating
the need for manual auditing.

**Win** **4:** **The** **Automated** **Score** **Aggregator** **(The**
**First** **"Big** **Win")**

**Timeline:** Week 7-8 (September 8 - September 19)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The 2 to 5 hours of focused manual work per batch spent on Manual Data
Consolidation & Reporting, which involves transcribing up to 10
different scores per hire from individual files into a master record.

**Our** **Solution:**

The first "Big Win" of our project. An automation that opens each
individual scorecard, extracts all required scores, and pastes them into
the "Master Training Performance Record" Google Sheet.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This delivers the single largest time saving of the 90-day plan. It
creates our version 1 "Unified Performance Command Center" and
completely eliminates data transcription errors, directly solving the
High Risk of Data Integrity Errors pain point

**Key** **Success** **Metric:** Reduce score aggregation time from 2-5
hours per batch to under 15 minutes.

**Win** **5:** **The** **Inter-Departmental** **&** **Basic**
**Scheduling** **Link**

**Timeline:** Week 9-10 (September 22 - October 3)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The trainer acts as a manual communication middleman for system access
requests and the error-prone process of manually creating calendar
invites for every single relevant event.

**Our** **Solution:**

Two simple workflows. One sends a templated email to the Billing
Executive for BackOffice access. The second creates the Day 1-2 training
events in Google Calendar and invites all new hires.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

With our core data pipeline stabilized, we can begin automating adjacent
communication and scheduling tasks, reducing context-switching and
improving professionalism.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Achieve 100% automated dispatch for initial access requests and Day 1-2
calendar invites.

**Win** **6:** **The** **Automated** **Feedback** **Loop**

**Timeline:** Week 11-12 (October 6 - October 17)

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The manual process of distributing surveys, managing compliance, and the
subjective, time-consuming analysis of qualitative feedback

**Our** **Solution:**

A system that automatically sends survey links to graduates and uses AI
to read text responses and provide a summary of key themes and potential
improvement areas.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':** This closes the loop on data collection
and introduces AI-powered analysis, turning anecdotal feedback into
actionable, data-driven insights. This addresses the "Lack of Automated
Analytics & Insight Generation".

**Key** **Success** **Metric:** Reduce time spent on survey
administration and analysis by 80%.

**The** **6-Month** **Vision:** **The** **Fully** **Intelligent**
**System**

With the foundation built, the next 90 days are focused on tackling the
most complex challenges and delivering advanced intelligence.

**Month** **4:** **The** **Advanced** **Scheduler**

**Timeline:** October - November 2025

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The highly complex Manual Scheduling Overhead for role-specific
assessments, buddy sessions, and mock tests, which consumes 2-5 hours
per batch and is extremely prone to coordination errors.

**Our** **Solution:**

An intelligent scheduler that reads a "Training Template," checks the
Google Calendars of required coaches for availability, and automatically
creates all role-specific events with the correct attendees.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This tackles the largest remaining manual process. It is a true "Big
Win" that is only possible now because our foundational data and basic
automation skills have been established.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Reduce complex scheduling and coordination time by 90%.

**Month** **5:** **The** **Predictive** **Early** **Warning** **System**

**Timeline:** November - December 2025

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:** The inability to systematically
identify struggling trainees early, with interventions often happening
too late. This moves from reactive coaching to proactive intervention.

**Our** **Solution:** A workflow that analyzes the aggregated data in
our "Master Training Performance Record." It will automatically flag any
trainee whose performance trends downwards or falls below a critical
threshold on key assessments.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':** This is the realization of the
"Predictive Intelligence" pillar. It allows the trainer to focus their
limited time on the individuals who need it most, dramatically improving
training outcomes.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:** Identify 90% of at-risk trainees at
least 2 days before their final mock tests.

**Month** **6:** **Full** **System** **Integration** **&**
**Optimization**

**Timeline:** December 2025 - January 2026

**Problem** **We** **Are** **Solving:**

The slight inefficiency of using a separate system (Google Workspace)
from our primary collaboration tool (Lark).

**Our** **Solution:**

With a proven system and 5 months of success metrics, we will build a
strong business case to acquire Lark API credentials. We will then begin
migrating our proven workflows into a more seamless, fully integrated
Lark-native system.

**The** **Strategic** **'Why':**

This final step optimizes the user experience for all stakeholders and
demonstrates our ability to manage a full project lifecycle, from a
pragmatic proof-of-concept to a fully integrated enterprise solution.

**Key** **Success** **Metric:**

Replicate 100% of the existing automation functionality within the Lark
ecosystem.
