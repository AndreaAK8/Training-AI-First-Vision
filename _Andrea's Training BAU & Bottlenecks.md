**Quantified** **Bottlenecks** **&** **Pain** **Points** **for**
**Automation** **Analysis**

> 1\. **Manual** **Scorecard** **Management**
>
> ● **Pain** **Point:** Creating and updating individual scorecards is
> highly time-consuming and prone to manual data entry errors. Each
> scorecard has a minimum of 4 tabs, increasing complexity.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:**
>
> ○ Andrea manually creates a new scorecard file for every new hire.
>
> ○ After each assessment, Andrea must locate the correct hire's file,
> navigate to the correct tab, and type in the scores and feedback.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Setup** **Time:** **2-3** **minutes** per new hire to create and
> format the scorecard.
>
> ○ **Data** **Entry** **Time:** **5-10** **minutes** per assessment to
> find the file, enter results, and add feedback for one person.
>
> ○ **Total** **Time** **per** **Batch:** For a typical batch of 10
> hires with 3-4 key evaluations each, this manual work accumulates to
> **3.5** **to** **4+** **hours** of Andrea's time.
>
> 2\. **Repetitive** **Guidance** **&** **Follow-Up**
>
> ● **Pain** **Point:** New hires with varying levels of proactivity
> frequently ask for information that has already been provided,
> requiring Andrea to stop higher-value work to repeat instructions.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea must personally and repeatedly direct
> learners to the location of training materials on the Lark Wiki and
> clarify instructions given during the briefing.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Time** **Cost:** This consumes up to **30** **minutes** of
> Andrea's time per training batch, detracting from focused coaching and
> feedback.
>
> 3\. **Manual** **Inter-departmental** **Communication** **Relay**
>
> ● **Pain** **Point:** The process to grant system access positions the
> trainer as a manual communication middleman, creating information lag
> and administrative overhead.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea acts as a human notification system.
> She sends the request, waits for a notification from Billing, and then
> must relay the confirmation back to each new hire.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Administrative** **Overhead:** This requires Andrea to perform a
> multi-step administrative task (send, wait, receive, relay) instead of
> focusing on training. It requires
>
> context-switching and introduces delay, as new hires cannot proceed
> until Andrea has relayed the final confirmation.
>
> 4\. **Inconsistent** **Briefing** **Delivery**
>
> ● **Pain** **Point:** The high volume of information to be delivered
> in kick-off briefings makes it difficult to ensure consistency and
> clarity for every batch, leading to follow-up questions.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea relies on memory and personal notes to
> deliver critical instructions. Key details can be accidentally missed
> or phrased differently each time.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Risk:** High risk of inconsistent training experience. The direct
> impact is measured by the time spent on "Repetitive Guidance"
> (Bottleneck \#2), which is caused by initial communication gaps.

**Process** **2:** **Scheduling** **and** **Preparing** **for** **a**
**New** **Training** **Batch**

**Goal:** To prepare and schedule a comprehensive training calendar for
a new batch of hires, covering the initial product training and
coordinating subsequent role-specific sessions.

**Key** **Parameters:**

> ● **Frequency:** Weekly or Bi-weekly, aligned with hiring cycles. ●
> **Average** **Batch** **Size:** 3-8 new hires.
>
> ● **Complexity:** Involves coordinating schedules for 9 distinct roles
> across 3 different regions (MY, PH, TH).

**Process** **Trigger:** The process begins every Friday after the HR
department updates the Master Training Calendar with a new list of
hires, their roles, and start dates.

**A.** **Trainer's** **Manual** **Actions** **(Andrea)**

This process can be broken into two distinct phases:
Scheduling/Coordination and Material Preparation.

**Phase** **1:** **Scheduling** **&** **Coordination** **(Performed**
**Weekly)**

> 1\. **Monitors** **Master** **Calendar:** Checks the Master Training
> Calendar every Friday to identify all new hires for the upcoming
> week's batch.
>
> 2\. **Blocks** **Core** **Training** **Time:** Manually creates
> calendar blocks in her own schedule for the Day 1 & 2 Product
> Knowledge sessions.
>
> 3\. **Cross-References** **Schedules:** Manually compares the "Master
> Training Calendar" (from HR) against the "Master Training Schedule"
> (the overall template) to map out the full 5-day plan for the batch.
>
> 4\. **Creates** **Individual** **Calendar** **Events:** Manually
> generates numerous, separate Lark Calendar events based on the batch
> composition (e.g., "Day 1 Product Training," "Day 3 BC People
> Engagement," "Day 4 Care Hardware Assessment"). The number of events
> is directly proportional to the number of unique roles in the batch.
>
> 5\. **Coordinates** **with** **Coaches:**
>
> 1\. Initiates Lark messages with coaches from various departments to
> confirm their availability for role-specific training sessions (e.g.,
> review sessions, mock tests).
>
> 2\. Gathers any special requests or adjustments needed for the
> schedule.
>
> 6\. **Blocks** **Coach** **&** **Trainee** **Time:** Manually creates
> and blocks calendar events that involve specific coaches and trainees
> from Day 3 onwards.
>
> 7\. **Dispatches** **Invitations:** Manually invites each specific new
> hire and the correct corresponding coach(es) to every single relevant
> calendar event, ensuring no one is missed or invited to the wrong
> session.

**Phase** **2:** **Asset** **&** **Material** **Preparation**
**(Performed** **per** **Batch/As** **Needed)**

> 1\. **Duplicates** **Scorecard** **Templates:** Manually creates
> copies of the "Assessment Scorecard Template" for each unique role
> present in the new batch (e.g., 5 roles in a batch requires creating 5
> separate scorecard files).
>
> 2\. **Shares** **Assets:** Manually shares the newly created
> scorecards with the relevant coaches before the training begins.
>
> 3\. **Reviews** **for** **Product** **Updates:** Manually monitors
> Lark Announcements and other channels for notifications about new
> product features or process changes.
>
> 4\. **Updates** **Training** **Slides:** When an update is found,
> manually opens the training presentation (.pptx file), incorporates
> the new information, adjusts the slide structure, and saves the new
> version.
>
> 5\. **Updates** **Wiki** **Documentation:** For role-specific process
> changes (e.g., a new sales pitching step), manually navigates to the
> correct Lark Wiki page and edits the content to reflect the update.

**Quantified** **Bottlenecks** **&** **Pain** **Points** **for**
**Automation** **Analysis**

**1.** **Manual** **Scheduling** **Overhead**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** The end-to-end process of scheduling for a
> single batch is a significant, recurring time drain that requires
> deep, uninterrupted focus.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Involves cross-referencing multiple sources,
> manually creating dozens of calendar events, and individually inviting
> participants.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:** This entire process consumes **2** **to**
> **5** **hours** **of** **manual** **work** per batch, depending on the
> size and complexity of the roles involved.

**2.** **High** **Risk** **of** **Coordination** **Errors**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** Manually dispatching a high volume of
> individualized calendar invites is extremely prone to human error.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea must meticulously check that the
> correct trainees and coaches are invited to the correct events.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Error** **Rate:** Coordination errors, such as missed invitations,
> occur approximately **twice** **a** **month** and often require a
> coach to proactively follow up with Andrea.
>
> ○ **Consequence:** This degrades the professionalism of the training
> experience and can cause session delays or require last-minute
> scrambling.

**3.** **Brittle** **&** **Reactive** **Scheduling**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** The manually created schedule is rigid and
> difficult to change. A single alteration creates a cascade of manual
> work.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** If a coach is unavailable or a new hire's
> start date changes, Andrea must manually review the entire calendar,
> de-conflict sessions, and reschedule all dependent events and
> participants one by one.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Frequency** **&** **Rework** **Time:** This type of reactive
> adjustment occurs **2-3** **times** **per** **month**, with each
> change requiring **15-25** **minutes** **of** **manual**
> **rescheduling** **effort** ***per*** ***affected*** ***role*.** A
> single change impacting three roles can consume over an hour of
> rework.
>
> ○ **Project** **Impact:** This reactive fire-fighting disrupts planned
> work on other BAU and project tasks, leading to delays.

**4.** **Reactive** **&** **Manual** **Content** **Management**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** Keeping training materials (Slides and Wiki)
> current is a reactive, manual, and disconnected process that requires
> both administrative and creative effort.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea must constantly monitor announcement
> channels, then manually edit multiple documents. This involves not
> just adding text, but also adding pictures, ensuring formatting looks
> good, and using creative skills to beautify slides.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Time** **Cost:** Each major content update cycle consumes **2-3**
> **hours** of this focused creative and administrative work.
>
> ○ **Risk:** High risk of delivering outdated information to new hires
> if an update is missed, undermining the training's effectiveness.

**5.** **Regional** **Resource** **Constraints**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** The availability of coaches is limited,
> especially across different regions, leading to frequent scheduling
> conflicts that the manual process cannot easily resolve.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** When a designated coach is unavailable,
> Andrea must manually re-initiate the coordination process: message
> other potential coaches, negotiate new times, and then execute the
> full manual rescheduling (as described in Bottleneck \#3).
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:** This is a primary driver of "Scheduling
> Chaos," frequently leading to training extensions and a poor
> experience for new hires who have their schedules constantly shifted.

**Process** **3:** **Post-Training** **Finalization**

**Goal:** To accurately consolidate new hire assessment scores,
calculate a final Training Performance Score based on complex,
role-specific assessment models (weighted 80% learning, 20%
participation), and gather feedback for program improvement.

**Key** **Parameters:**

> ● **Frequency:** Event-driven; occurs each time a new hire completes
> their training program. ● **Scope:** 3-8 new hires per batch, on
> average.

**Process** **Trigger:** A new hire completes their final scheduled
training day or assessment.

**A.** **Trainer's** **Manual** **Actions** **(Andrea)**

This process consists of two main phases: finalizing performance records
and collecting post-training feedback.

**Phase** **1:** **Performance** **Record** **Finalization** **&**
**Communication** **(Per** **Hire/Batch)**

> 1\. **Retrieves** **Individual** **Records:** Manually locates and
> opens the individual Assessment Scorecard file for each graduating new
> hire.
>
> 2\. **Audits** **for** **Completion:** Manually reviews scorecards to
> ensure coaches have filled them out. If data is missing or an
> assessment was skipped, Andrea must pause her work to manually message
> the coach, chase for the missing scores, and await their update.
>
> 3\. **Aggregates** **Scores** **for** **Final** **Calculation:**
>
> 1\. Manually locates and transcribes the raw scores for every weighted
> assessment (e.g., up to 10 different scores for a Business Consultant)
> from the individual scorecard into the "Master Training Performance
> Record."
>
> 2\. Relies on pre-set formulas in the Master Record to calculate the
> final weighted score based on the transcribed data. The complexity
> lies in ensuring the many individual scores are transcribed correctly
> for the formula to work.
>
> 4\. **Composes** **Performance** **Summaries:** Manually writes a
> qualitative summary of each new hire's performance, highlights, and
> lowlights in a "comment box" field within the master record.
>
> 5\. **Dispatches** **Coach** **Updates:** Manually composes and sends
> a Lark message to the respective coach for each new hire, summarizing
> the key performance points from the comment box.

**Phase** **2:** **Feedback** **Collection** **&** **Analysis**
**(Weekly** **Cycle)**

> 1\. **Distributes** **Survey:** On the Monday following a training
> completion, manually sends a Lark Survey form to all recent graduates.
>
> 2\. **Manages** **Compliance:** Manually checks the number of survey
> submissions and sends one mass reminder via Lark to encourage
> completion by the specified deadline.
>
> 3\. **Analyzes** **Qualitative** **Feedback:** Manually reads through
> all comments and feedback submitted in the Lark Survey.
>
> 4\. **Formulates** **Action** **Plans:** Based on the manual review,
> personally conceptualizes and decides on potential improvement areas,
> action plans, or "alarming signs" to watch for in the training
> program.

**Quantified** **Bottlenecks** **&** **Pain** **Points** **for**
**Automation** **Analysis**

**1.** **Manual** **Data** **Consolidation** **&** **Reporting**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** The entire process of closing out a batch is a
> significant, repetitive time sink involving data chasing,
> transcription, and manual communication.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Involves auditing coach submissions, chasing
> for missing data, copying/pasting numerous data points across various
> tabs, writing individual summaries, and composing separate update
> messages.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:** This end-to-end process consumes **2**
> **to** **5** **hours** **of** **focused** **manual** **work** per
> batch, depending on its size and the completeness of the source data.

**2.** **High** **Risk** **of** **Data** **Integrity** **Errors**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** Data integrity is compromised by both manual
> transcription errors and incomplete source data from coach scorecards,
> making final reports unreliable.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea must not only transcribe up to 10
> different scores per hire without error but also act as an auditor,
> chasing coaches for missing data. The complexity of different
> weighting models for each role increases the cognitive load and chance
> of error.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Discovery** **&** **Rework:** Errors are typically discovered
> reactively, only **when** **a** **coach** **questions** **the**
> **data**. This triggers a time-consuming manual process of retrieving
> the original scorecard to diagnose the error, chasing the coach if
> needed, and correcting the master records.

**3.** **Lack** **of** **Automated** **Analytics** **&** **Insight**
**Generation**

> ● **Pain** **Point:** The current process does not automatically
> generate insights or measure the success of the training program. The
> burden of analysis falls entirely on the trainer.
>
> ● **Manual** **Effort:** Andrea must manually read all qualitative
> feedback and attempt to spot trends, connect them to performance data,
> and formulate action plans from scratch.
>
> ● **Quantified** **Impact:**
>
> ○ **Subjective** **Analysis:** Improvement plans are based on Andrea's
> personal interpretation rather than objective, data-driven insights,
> which can be inconsistent and difficult to justify.
>
> ○ **"Invisible** **Impact":** Without a proper reporting system, it is
> difficult to measure or demonstrate the value and ROI of the training
> program to leadership, making its success feel intangible.
