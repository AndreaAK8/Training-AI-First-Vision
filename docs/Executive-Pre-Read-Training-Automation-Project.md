**2. Data Source Stability (Win 4 Completion)**
- **Required:** Consistent structure of 9 assessment response sheets
- **Impact if Changed:** May require workflow adjustments
- **Mitigation:** Built flexible parsing logic; can adapt to minor structural changes
- **Current Status:** Stable, no anticipated changes

**3. Google Workspace Access & Permissions**
- **Required:** Continued access to Google Sheets, Drive, Calendar APIs
- **Impact if Disrupted:** All automations rely on Google Workspace integration
- **Mitigation:** Using official APIs with proper authentication; stable for 3+ months
- **Backup Plan:** Can pivot to Lark API integration if needed (Month 6 exploration)

---

### Technical Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Win 4 aggregation complexity | 2-week delay | Medium | Parallel processing architecture; built in 20% time buffer |
| AI model accuracy for Win 6 | Reduced confidence | Low | GPT-4 has >85% accuracy on similar tasks; can fine-tune prompts |
| Advanced scheduler coordination | 3-week delay | Medium | Independent from other systems; won't block core ecosystem |
| API rate limits or costs | Budget overrun | Low | Monitoring usage; built caching; can adjust API calls if needed |

---

### Resource Requirements

**Current Resources:**
- **Development:** Andrea K. (Sr. Training & KB Specialist) - 60% time allocation
- **Platform:** n8n automation (self-hosted), Google Workspace, existing infrastructure
- **Costs:** Minimal operational costs (currently <$20/month for n8n hosting)

**Additional Resources Needed:**
- **OpenAI API:** $50-100/month (for Win 6 AI-powered analysis)
- **Time Allocation:** Continue 60% allocation through January 2026

- **Recommendation:** Proceed with Option A (predictive intelligence builds on Win 4 data)

**2. AI Avatar Pilot Scope**
- **Recommendation:** Start with 3 personas, gather user feedback, expand based on results
- **Alternative:** Skip AI avatars in Phase 1, focus on Early Warning and Scheduler
- **Trade-off:** Avatars are innovative but non-critical; can defer if timeline tight

**3. Lark API Integration Exploration**
- **Timing:** Month 6 (January 2026)
- **Purpose:** Potential migration from Google Workspace to Lark-native automation
- **Recommendation:** Build business case based on 6 months of Google-based success
