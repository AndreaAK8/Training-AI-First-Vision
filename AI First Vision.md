>
> 💔 **The** **Pain** **We're** **Killing** **(Your** **Current**
> **Reality)**
>
> 🚧 **Andrea's** **Training** **Pain:** **The** **Manual**
> **Nightmare**
>
> **The** **Scheduling** **Hell:**
>
> 1\. ⏰ **Half-Day** **Needed** **for** **Complex** **Multi-Role**
> **Batches**
>
> When training multiple roles in a single batch (e.g., BC + MSM), we
> need to juggle both shared and role-specific content. This requires
> careful planning and often takes up half a day just to align the
> training roadmap before execution.
>
> 2\. 🔄 **Manual** **Calendar** **Juggling**
>
> Any changes in coach availability require manual rescheduling across
> multiple participants, which becomes chaotic, especially when multiple
> trainings are running concurrently.
>
> 3\. 📅 **“My** **Calendar** **Gets** **So** **Messed** **Up”**
>
> Lack of automated scheduling tools or standardization results in a
> cluttered and error-prone calendar, leading to missed syncs,
> double-bookings, or inefficient use of time.
>
> 4\. 🏃 **Last-Minute** **Scrambles** **for** **BC** **Reschedules**
>
> BCs often have last-minute operational duties, requiring urgent
> rescheduling. Without a buffer system or easy rebooking process, this
> disrupts flow and adds unnecessary admin stress.
>
> **The** **Assessment** **Agony:**
>
> 1\. 📊 **Manually** **Copying** **Scores** **from** **Lark** **Docs**
>
> Currently, scores are stored in separate documents and need to be
> manually extracted, which is time consuming and increases the risk of
> human error, especially with large batches.
>
> 2\. ✍ **Writing** **Performance** **Summaries** **From** **Memory**
>
> Trainers often write feedback after the session, relying on memory.
> This risks inaccurate evaluations and inconsistency across learners,
> especially if no real-time tracking system is used.
>
> 3\. 🔢 **“If** **It’s** **Five** **Learners,** **It** **Takes** **Me**
> **30+** **Minutes”**
>
> Without a central system, assessments and summaries become a
> repetitive manual task. Scaling this for larger groups eats into
> valuable training time.
>
> 4\. 📑 **Different** **Assessments** **per** **Role** **=**
> **Multiplied** **Complexity**
>
> Each role has different KPIs and assessment formats, requiring
> multiple versions of trackers, forms, and scoring rubrics. This adds
> to the trainer’s cognitive and admin load.
>
> **The** **Bottlenecks:**
>
> ○ 👥 **Limited** **Coaches** **vs** **High** **Number** **of**
> **Participants** **(Specifically** **sales)**
>
> 1\. With a high volume of participants and limited coaches available,
> it becomes challenging to provide equal attention and maintain
> training quality. This often leads to either extending the training
> timeline or compromising schedule accuracy, affecting both the team’s
> bandwidth and the learner experience.
>
> ○ 📚 **Knowledge** **Base** **Resources** **Are** **Incomplete**
>
> 2\. Some existing KB articles lack sufficient detail or clarity,
> making them unreliable for learners to independently reinforce
> concepts. This increases dependency on live coaching time and creates
> confusion, especially for new hires who need structured, step-by-step
> learning.
>
> ○ 🔄 **Managing** **Varying** **Learning** **Needs** **Before**
> **Role-Specific** **Split**
>
> 3\. Before participants split into their role-specific training, it’s
> important they understand the core context. However, learning needs
> vary by role:
>
> ● **BCs** need to grasp features through the lens of pain points and
> selling angles.
>
> ○ **MSMs** need a deeper understanding of how features support
> business operations. ● This creates a need for dual-layered
> facilitation, which adds complexity and time.
>
> ○ ⏱ **High** **Time** **Spent** **on** **Logistics**
>
> 4\. Significant time is spent on tasks like scheduling, follow-ups,
> platform access issues, and coordinating sessions. These operational
> aspects consume time that could otherwise be used for actual knowledge
> transfer or learner engagement.
>
> ○ 🐢 **Managing** **Different** **Learning** **Speeds**
>
> 5\. Some learners grasp content quickly while others require more time
> or ask frequent questions. With tight training durations, it’s
> difficult to balance both without leaving someone behind or slowing
> down others. This impacts learning effectiveness and schedule control.
>
> 🚧 **Ain's** **KB** **Pain:** **The** **Reactive** **Scramble**
>
> **Update** **Chaos:**
>
> 1\. 🧠 **Knowledge** **Lives** **in** **One** **Person's** **Head**
>
> ○ The current update process relies heavily on Andrea’s individual
> memory and experience. This is a single point of failure risk if
> Andrea is unavailable, the update workflow becomes unclear, causing
> delays or missed changes.
>
> 2\. 📢 **From** **Announcement** **→** **Manual** **Update** **(No**
> **Trigger** **System)**
>
> After announcements, there’s no automated flow to prompt or track KB
> updates. The process relies on someone remembering to do it, which
> increases chances of missed or outdated content.
>
> 3\. ❓ **“What** **If** **You’re** **Not** **There** **Tomorrow?”**
>
> The system lacks documented SOPs or shared visibility, making it hard
> for others (like Ain) to step in. This creates onboarding friction,
> disrupts continuity, and slows down handovers.
>
> **The** **Quality** **Crisis:**
>
> 1\. 🎯 **Overhauls** **May** **Create** **Inconsistencies**
>
> While overhauls aim to improve quality, they can unintentionally
> introduce tone, structure, or factual inconsistencies, especially when
> done without standardized templates or review processes.
>
> 2\. 📝 **No** **Standardization** **Between** **Andrea** **&** **Ain**
>
> Different writing styles, priorities, and interpretations between
> Andrea and Ain lead to inconsistent article formats and user
> experiences. This becomes more noticeable in bulk updates or audits.
>
> 3\. 🤖 **Unclear** **Requirements** **for** **New** **Fin** **AI**
>
> While new requirements are emerging for Fin AI support, the criteria
> and structure are still vague. Without clear guidance, there's a risk
> of misalignment or rework down the line.
>
> 4\. ⚠ **Gaps** **Only** **Surface** **When** **Merchants**
> **Complain**
>
> Content gaps are often detected after merchants raise issues, meaning
> knowledge delivery is reactive rather than preventative. This delays
> resolution, affects customer experience, and highlights the need for a
> more systematic QA process.
>
> 5\. 🔄 **Manual,** **Reactive,** **and** **Prone** **to** **Delays**
>
> Updates are usually reactive rather than proactive, often triggered by
> issues rather than planned improvements. Without automation or checks,
> this creates slower turnaround and inconsistent content health.
